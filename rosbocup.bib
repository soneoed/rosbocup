	walking on two legs. The gait can be parameterized using walking

@inproceedings{Chestnutt2005,
	Abstract = {Despite the recent achievements in stable dynamic walking for many
	humanoid robots, relatively little navigation autonomy has been
	achieved. In particular, the ability to autonomously select foot
	placement positions to avoid obstacles while walking is an important
	step towards improved navigation autonomy for humanoids. We present
	a footstep planner for the Honda ASIMO humanoid robot that plans
	a sequence of footstep positions to navigate toward a goal location
	while avoiding obstacles. The possible future foot placement positions
	are dependent on the current state of the robot. Using a finite
	set of state-dependent actions, we use an A* search to compute optimal
	sequences of footstep locations up to a time-limited planning horizon.
	We present experimental results demonstrating the robot navigating
	through both static and dynamic known environments that include
	obstacles moving on predictable trajectories.},

@article{Hebbel2006,
	Abstract = {This paper presents an efficient way to learn fast omnidirectional quadrupedal walking gaits. We show that the common approaches to control the legs can be further improved by allowing more degrees of freedom in the trajectory generation for the legs. To achieve good omnidirectional movements, we suggest to use different parameters for different walk requests and interpolate between them. The approach has been implemented for the Sony Aibo and used by the GermanTeam in the Four-Legged-League in 2005. A standard learning strategy has been adopted, so that the optimization process of a parameter set can be done within one hour, without human intervention. The resulting walk achieved remarkable speeds, both in pure forward walking and in omnidirectional movements. },

@article{Chalup2007,
	Abstract = {Robot learning is a growing area of research at the intersection of robotics and machine learning. The main contributions of this paper include a review of how machine learning has been used on Sony AIBO robots and at RoboCup, with a focus on the four-legged league during the years 1998-2004. The review shows that the application-oriented use of machine learning in the four-legged league was still conservative and restricted to a few well-known and easy-to-use methods such as standard decision trees, evolutionary hill climbing, and support vector machines. Method-oriented spin-off studies emerged more frequently and increasingly addressed new and advanced machine learning techniques. Further, the paper presents some details about the growing impact of machine learning in the software system developed by the authors' robot soccer team-the NUbots},

	Abstract = {Passive-dynamic walkers are simple mechanical devices, composed of
	solid parts connected by joints, that walk stably down a slope.
	They have no motors or controllers, yet can have remarkably humanlike
	motions. This suggests that these machines are useful models of
	human locomotion; however, they cannot walk on level ground. Here
	we present three robots based on passive-dynamics, with small active
	power sources substituted for gravity, which can walk on level ground.
	These robots use less control and less energy than other powered
	robots, yet walk more naturally, further suggesting the importance
	of passive-dynamics in human locomotion.},

	Abstract = {We present a method to optimize the walking pattern of a humanoid robot for forward speed using suitable metaheuristics. Our starting point is a hand-tuned open-loop gait that we enhance with two feedback control mechanisms. First, we employ a P-controller that regulates the foot angle in order to reduce angular velocity of the robot's body. Second, we introduce a phase resetting mechanism that starts the next step at the moment of foot contact. Using a physics-based simulation, we demonstrate that such feedback control is essential for achieving fast and robust locomotion.},
